# Kanban Board Implementation

## Overview
A full-featured Kanban board has been implemented for the Taskava application with drag-and-drop functionality, backend integration, and comprehensive task management capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Drag and Drop Functionality**
- Built using @dnd-kit (modern, performant drag-and-drop library)
- Smooth drag animations and visual feedback
- Support for dragging tasks between columns (sections)
- Reordering tasks within the same column
- Visual indicators when hovering over drop zones

### 2. **Backend Integration**
- Full API integration with task and section endpoints
- Automatic fallback to mock data when backend is unavailable
- Real-time updates using Zustand state management
- Optimistic UI updates for smooth user experience

### 3. **Task Management**
- Create new tasks with comprehensive details
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Update task status when moving between columns
- Support for task priorities, due dates, tags, and assignees

### 4. **UI Components**
- **KanbanBoard**: Main board component with drag-and-drop context
- **KanbanColumn**: Individual column representing a section
- **KanbanCard**: Draggable task card with rich information display
- **KanbanView**: Top-level view with project selector and filters
- **SimpleTaskDialog**: Task creation/editing dialog

### 5. **Visual Features**
- Priority indicators with color coding
- Due date display with overdue highlighting
- Assignee avatars
- Comment counts
- Tag badges
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Grip handle for dragging

## File Structure

├── KanbanBoard.tsx       # Main board with DnD context
├── KanbanColumn.tsx      # Column component (droppable area)
├── KanbanCard.tsx        # Draggable task card
├── KanbanView.tsx        # Complete view with project selector

/taskava-frontend/src/store/
└── useTaskStore.ts       # Zustand store for task management

/taskava-frontend/src/mocks/
└── mockData.ts          # Mock data for development/demo
```

## Usage

### Accessing the Kanban Board
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/tasks
2. The board will automatically load with mock data if the backend is not available

### Creating Tasks
1. Click the "+" button in any column header
2. Fill in task details in the dialog
3. Click "Create Task" to add the task to the column

### Moving Tasks
1. Hover over a task card to see the grip handle
2. Click and drag the task to move it
3. Drop it in a different column to change its status
4. Drop it within the same column to reorder

### Editing Tasks
1. Click on any task card to open the edit dialog
2. Or use the dropdown menu (three dots) and select "Edit task"
3. Update the details and save

### Project Selection
- Use the dropdown at the top to switch between projects
- Each project has its own set of sections and tasks

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **Zustand Store** (`useTaskStore`): Manages all task-related state
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Error handling with automatic rollback on failure

### Drag and Drop
- **@dnd-kit/core**: Core drag-and-drop functionality
- **@dnd-kit/sortable**: Sortable lists within columns
- Custom drag overlay for visual feedback during drag

### API Integration
- Full CRUD operations for tasks
- Section management endpoints
- Automatic mock data fallback in development mode
- React Query for server state caching

### Mock Data
The implementation includes comprehensive mock data:
- 3 sample projects (Website Redesign, Mobile App, Marketing Campaign)
- Multiple sections per project
- 25+ sample tasks with various states
- 4 mock users with avatars

## Backend Endpoints Used

```typescript
// Task operations
GET    /api/tasks?sectionId={id}
POST   /api/tasks
PUT    /api/tasks/{id}
PATCH  /api/tasks/{id}/status
DELETE /api/tasks/{id}

// Project and section operations
GET    /api/projects
GET    /api/projects/{id}/sections
POST   /api/projects/{id}/sections
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Tasks are fetched per section
2. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, syncs with backend
3. **Memoization**: Components use React.memo where appropriate
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Ready for implementation with large task lists
5. **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive API calls during drag operations

## Customization Options

### Task Status Mapping
The system automatically maps section names to task statuses:
- "To Do" → `todo`
- "In Progress" → `in_progress`
- "In Review" → `in_review`
- "Done" → `done`
- "Blocked" → `blocked`

### Priority Levels
- Low (gray)
- Medium (blue)
- High (orange)
- Urgent (red)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. Bulk task operations
2. Keyboard shortcuts for task management
3. Task filtering and search
4. Subtasks support
5. Custom fields per project
6. Activity feed and notifications
7. Board view customization (compact/expanded)
8. Export functionality
9. Task templates
10. Time tracking integration

## Testing the Implementation

1. **With Mock Data** (Default in development):
   - Simply navigate to /tasks
   - Three projects with tasks will be available

2. **With Backend**:
   - Ensure backend is running on port 8080
   - Create projects and sections via API
   - Tasks will be fetched from the database

3. **Drag and Drop Testing**:
   - Try dragging tasks between columns
   - Test reordering within columns
   - Verify status updates when moving tasks

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

The implementation uses modern JavaScript features and CSS properties. Ensure your browser is up to date for the best experience.
