## Notes

These tasks were removed from TASKS.md on 2025-08-13 because:
1. They represent documentation that already exists in PRD.md
2. They are not actionable technical implementation tasks
3. Keeping them in TASKS.md was creating confusion about what needs to be built vs what needs to be documented
4. The focus should be on building the actual product features, not re-documenting existing specifications

If these documentation tasks become relevant in the future (e.g., for creating user-facing documentation or help content), they can be restored from this archive.
